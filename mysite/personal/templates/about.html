        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
            In my life I had the fortune to gain all sorts of experience in various profession from sales to charity and
            in that path I have been blessed to work with excellent people, which were the jacks of their trades. So
            firs and foremost lesson I learned is that one needs to pursue their passion. That is how I stepped on the
            path of "IT gal".
            With my colorful background of work experiences I gained the experience of working in teams and with people
            of different varieties.
        </p>

        <p>So now I am a professional and versatile software engineer graduate, with experience in the layout, design
            and coding of websites and also in designing and implementing resourceful solutions which support frequent
            UI and functionality changes. As a passionate software developer I strive to always improve my techniques
            and keep in pace with trends in the industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my spare time I like educate myself with new trends and gain knowledge.I also like to do sports. Recently
            I took up bicycle riding and I found it is super fun because it enables me to experience landscapes of
            nature in a different way than I did until now.

  <h3>Designer Templates</h3>

  <p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

  <h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

  <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

  <h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

  <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
